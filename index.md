I've been fortunate to be a part of the massive undergraduate teaching community at UC Berkeley.
- I will be an instructor for Principles and Techniques of Data Science ([Data 100](http://ds100.org/su20)) this summer.
- In total, I have been a teaching assistant for 8 semesters across 5 different courses. (See [Teaching](../teaching) for more details.)
- I was a recipient of the [EECS Distinguished GSI Award](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Students/Awards/13/) for 2019-2020, and of the campus [Outstanding GSI Award](https://gsi.berkeley.edu/programs-services/award-programs/ogsi/ogsi-2018/) for 2017-2018.

In addition to being a teaching assistant:
- I created and taught [Introduction to Mathematical Thinking](http://imt-decal.org) for two semesters (Fall 2018, Spring 2019).
  - The goal of the student-run course (through the DeCal program) was to prepare students for our extremely challenging introductory discrete math and probability course that students need to do well in in order to declare the Computer Science major.
- I was a part of [Computer Science Mentors](https://csmentors.berkeley.edu/) in various capacities for six semesters, serving on the leadership committee for five.
  - Computer Science Mentors is a student-run organization that facilitates small group tutoring for the introductory computer science and electrical engineering courses at Berkeley.
