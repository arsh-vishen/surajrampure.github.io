My name is Suraj Rampure, and I'm a junior studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley. I'm from Windsor, Ontario, a small Canadian town that's ten minutes south of Detroit and three hours south of Toronto. I like dogs (shout out to Rex and Junior), cars, technology (Apple) and rooting for whatever team LeBron plays for (go <del>Cavs</del> Lakers!).

### Academia

Teaching consumes a large part of my day, but I wouldn't have it any other way. 

- Fall 2018 is my third semester as an **Undergraduate Student Instructor**, i.e. Teaching Assistant, in the EECS department at UC Berkeley. I'm currently a TA for ???, but have also TA'd Data 8 (introductory data science) and CS 61A (introductory programming) in the past. Check out my teaching page [here](link to teaching page). I was a recipient of the [outstanding GSI award](http://gsi.berkeley.edu/programs-services/award-programs/ogsi/ogsi-2018/) for the 2017-2018 year, an award that is given annually to the top ~9% of GSIs in each department.

- The Fall 2018 semester is also the inaugural semester of **[Introduction to Mathematical Thinking](http://imt-decal.org)**, a 2-unit student-run course that I created in order to prepare students for our extremely challenging introductory discrete math and probability course that students need to do well in in order to declare the Computer Science major. You can read the textbook I wrote for it [here](http://book.imt-decal.org). 

- This is my fourth semester as a part of **[Computer Science Mentors](http://csmberkeley.github.io)**, an organization that facilitates small group tutoring for the introductory computer science and electrical engineering courses at Berkeley. CSM's work is extremely important; some of these courses have enrollments well over 1000 students, and by offering group tutoring, we help make the course smaller and effectively help more students pursue computer science as a major. I'm currently the External Vice President, but served as the CS 70 coordinator for FA17 and SP18.

### Other

- In the summer of 2018, I was a software engineering intern at **[McKinsey & Co.](mckinsey.com)** in New York City, where I worked on the Healthcare Analytics and Delivery team. My work was primarily in Python, SQL and JavaScript.

- Previously, I was a director for **[Cal Hacks](http://calhacks.io)**, Berkeley's largest annual hackathon. 

- I also was the director of curriculum development for **[Data Science for India](http://datascienceforindia.com)**, an organization that aims to broaden access to data science skills across India. I helped oversee the creation of a curriculum that was based off of Berkeley courses, but accessible to students with no prior computing knowledge.
