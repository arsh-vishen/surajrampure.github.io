Introduction: Why there is a need for undergraduate assistants (large classes)

Semantics of Roles
- Lab Assistants (unpaid, no selection process, only requirement is to have taken the course. help in lab sections and/or office hours. ~3-6 hours per week, but can vary)
- Readers / Paid Tutors (what some people think of when they hear "TA". grade assignments, occasionally staff office hours. those in the paid tutor role may host small group tutoring sections of up to 6 students. usually ~8 hours a week, but can also vary. hourly rate is 15-19 an hour depending on the specific role.)
- Teaching Assistants (undergraduate student instructors) (full TAs. traditionally graduate students (usually called GSIs) but in CS and occasionally stats/math undergrads are allowed. teach a discussion section and/or lab section, depending on the course. run the course logistically. create and grade assignments and exams. office hours as well. get in-state portion of tuition refunded if appointment is over 10 hours, so vast majority are 8 hours, with some being 10, 15 or 20. hourly rate is 25/hour, plus tuition reimbursement if applicable). 

CSM – unpaid small group tutoring
- currently working towards a solution where these roles are also paid
- only for 61a, 61b, 70 and ee16a, but 61c pilot this upcoming semester
- reach over 1000 students per semester, average mentor satisfaction > 4
- ~200 mentors this past semester, each teaching on average 5 students for 1 - 1.5 h a week

Other teaching related things
- Common for graduating seniors to be summer instructors for courses that they've TA'd in the past. 

Other points
- Undergraduates have either taken the course they teach for or one that is more advanced; this is in comparison to grad students who may have done undergrad elsewhere and haven't taken the course
- Undergraduates CARE, they choose to teach their peers in lieu of doing other things they may have to do; culture of excellence amongst the undergraduate teaching staff of going above and beyond to provide for the students
- Students can relate to people who took the class and are of a similar age
- Extremely rewarding experience
- "don't have the experience and insight of a graduate student" - not to be ignored. only recruit highly qualified students, who did well in the course or have since demonstrated a mastery of the material (it's possible to not do well in a course during your first go around, learn the material later and then be able to teach it)

"I don't want to send my kid to Berkeley just to be taught by other undergrads"

Things we use!
- Piazza: many other departments use it as well. forum where students can ask questions, and have other students or instructors answer. students can ask anonymously. effectively monitored 24/7 by instructors. 
- Gradescope: created at Berkeley (and still headquartered in downtown Berkeley) as a project by the CS 188 staff within the last 5 years! students can upload homework as pdfs. instructors create a rubric template for each problem. can grade 1000 answers to a single problem in just a few hours, less if its multiple choice due to AI grading. multiple questions can be graded at once, because you don't need the physical exam. can grade from anywhere. exams as well.

It's not a secret that demand for courses in computer science and related fields is at an all-time high. CS 61A, the first computer science course in the three-course sequence required to declare the Computer Science major, is set to enroll 1700 students for Fall 2018. Data 8, a new course that teaches introductory data science skills that are applicable to students of all major, has grown rapidly - this fall will be the seventh time it's offered, and more than 1300 students will be taking it. 

The traditional approach of having a single professor and a few graduate teaching assistants doesn't scale to courses of this size. Instead, many courses – both at introductory and advanced levels – in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences department have massive teams of undergraduate teaching instructors (formally known as Graduate Student Instructors), graders, tutors and lab assistants that help faculty teach the course. It's not uncommon to have over 50 paid undergraduate staff members associated with a course, in addition to hundreds of volunteer assistants. 

The resulting phenomenon is one where many un
